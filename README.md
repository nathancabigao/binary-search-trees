# Binary Search Trees
A Ruby Binary Search Tree implementation.

This Binary Search Tree implementation was made creating Tree classes made up of Node objects, and recreates commonly associated methods/functions for BSTs (insert, delete, traversals, height, depth, find, etc.)

This project was done for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-binary-search-trees).

## Instructions
To run the driver script to test the implementation, clone the repo and run the following from the root folder:
`ruby ./main.rb`

## Afterword
This project was a great revisit to BSTs for me. I am quite familiar with BSTs from my CS courses in University, and this was a refreshing exercise, especially when looking at depth-level tree traversal, and the different kinds (preorder, inorder, postorder). My familiarity with the concepts helped me quite a bit, especially when realizing that rebalancing the tree simply uses inorder traversal to sort the node values in an array. I had a lot of fun making this project, and look forward to the final project in the "A Bit of Computer Science" section of TOP's Ruby course.
